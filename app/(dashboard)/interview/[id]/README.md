# MBB Case Interview Simulation Guide

This document provides a detailed breakdown of the Management Consulting (MBB) case interview process, serving as a guide for the CaseXCase interview simulator.

## I. Overview of the Case Interview

A case interview is a problem-solving exercise where the interviewer presents a business scenario, and the candidate analyzes the situation, develops a solution, and presents recommendations, simulating the actual work consultants do for clients.

**Purpose:**
- Assess problem-solving skills
- Evaluate analytical thinking
- Gauge business acumen
- Determine communication abilities
- Analyze the candidate's poise under pressure

**Firms:**
- MBB: McKinsey & Company, Boston Consulting Group (BCG), Bain & Company
- Other consulting firms (Big Four, specialized firms)

## II. Case Interview Structure

The case interview typically follows this structure:

### 1. Opening
- Interviewer introduces themselves
- Candidate introduces themselves (briefly)
- Interviewer sets the stage for the case

### 2. Case Presentation
- Interviewer presents a business problem or scenario, which could involve:
  - Profitability decline
  - Market entry
  - Mergers and acquisitions
  - Operational efficiency
  - Growth strategy
- The interviewer provides some initial information

### 3. Clarifying Questions
- The candidate asks questions to understand the problem fully
- **Purpose:**
  - Gather missing information
  - Define the scope of the problem
  - Show engagement and critical thinking
- **Example questions:**
  - "Can you tell me more about the market size?"
  - "What are the client's primary objectives?"
  - "What is the timeline for this project?"

### 4. Structuring the Problem (Framework)
- The candidate develops a logical framework to break down the problem
- **Purpose:**
  - Provide a structured approach
  - Ensure all relevant areas are considered
  - Demonstrate analytical thinking
- The candidate should communicate their framework clearly to the interviewer

### 5. Analysis
- The candidate uses their framework to analyze the data provided
- This may involve:
  - Quantitative analysis (calculations, data interpretation)
  - Qualitative analysis (market trends, competitive landscape)
- The candidate should "think out loud" to show their thought process

### 6. Recommendation
- The candidate provides a clear and concise recommendation to address the problem
- The recommendation should be:
  - Actionable
  - Supported by the analysis
  - Realistic
- The candidate should explain the reasoning behind the recommendation

### 7. Conclusion
- The candidate summarizes the key findings and recommendations
- The interviewer may ask follow-up questions or probe deeper into certain areas

## III. Exhibit Handling (IMPORTANT)

**Key Principle: In real MBB case interviews, exhibits are ONLY provided when specifically requested by the candidate.**

- Exhibits (charts, tables, data) should NOT be automatically shown to the candidate
- The candidate must explicitly ask for specific data or information
- When requested, exhibits should be relevant to the specific request
- Common exhibit requests:
  - Market size data
  - Financial information (revenue, costs, profits)
  - Customer segmentation
  - Competitive analysis
  - Industry trends

**Implementation Note:** The AI interviewer should NEVER proactively offer exhibits. It should only generate and provide exhibits when the interviewee explicitly asks for specific data that would be relevant to visualize.

## IV. Common Case Interview Frameworks

Frameworks are structured approaches to break down business problems:

### Profitability Framework
- Breaks down profit into revenue and costs
- Useful for cases involving profit decline or improvement
- Formula: Profit = Revenue - Costs
- Drill down:
  - Revenue: Price * Volume; Segment by product, customer, channel
  - Costs: Fixed Costs, Variable Costs; Segment by cost driver, department

### Market Sizing
- Estimates the size of a market
- Useful for market entry or new product cases
- Approach:
  - Top-down: Start with a large population and narrow it down
  - Bottom-up: Start with a small unit and scale it up

### Porter's Five Forces
- Analyzes the competitive forces in an industry
- Useful for market entry or competitive analysis
- Forces:
  - Threat of new entrants
  - Bargaining power of suppliers
  - Bargaining power of buyers
  - Threat of substitute products
  - Industry rivalry

### 3C's (or 4C's)
- Analyzes the key factors in a business situation
- 3C's: Company, Customers, Competitors
- 4C's: Company, Customers, Competitors, Capabilities

### 4P's (Marketing Mix)
- Analyzes the marketing strategy of a product or service
- Elements: Product, Price, Place, Promotion

### SWOT Analysis
- Evaluates the internal and external factors affecting a business
- Factors: Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats

### MECE Principle
- Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive
- A guiding principle for structuring problems
- Ensures that the framework is comprehensive and avoids overlaps

## V. The Interviewee's Style

Consulting firms look for candidates who demonstrate the following qualities:

- **Structured Thinking:** Ability to break down complex problems
- **Analytical Skills:** Ability to interpret data and draw conclusions
- **Problem-Solving Skills:** Ability to develop creative and practical solutions
- **Communication Skills:** Clear and concise communication
- **Business Acumen:** Understanding of basic business concepts
- **Poise and Confidence:** Ability to remain calm under pressure
- **Client-Centric Approach:** Focus on delivering value
- **Initiative:** Asks clarifying questions and takes ownership

## VI. Implementation Notes for the Simulator

1. **Exhibit Generation:** Exhibits should ONLY be provided when explicitly requested by the interviewee
2. **Framework Guidance:** The AI should NOT suggest frameworks unless explicitly asked
3. **Interviewer Behavior:** Maintain professional but challenging tone
4. **Realistic Challenge:** Push the interviewee with follow-up questions
5. **Response Quality:** Avoid unnecessary praise and focus on substantive feedback
